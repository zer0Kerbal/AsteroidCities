# Asteroid Cities (KMAC)

Klockheed Martian Engine Manufacture - Asteroid Cities. I was frustrated with how little you can do with asteroids. This pack adds water to asteroids and provides parts to create fuel depots with refineries and greenhouses for cities. For Kerbal Space Program.

#### IMPORTANT

* The new grabbers are turned around. If you have ships in space or can't load your assembly, you can bring back your old grabbers by copying them back from the "Legacy" folder to the "Gamedata" folder.

Changelog:

V0.1 Initial release

V0.2 Updated conversion rates to avoid magic mass increase, increased electricity drain.

V0.3 Resource Generator improvements

* Resource generator stops when running out of one input resource
* Resource converter stops when running out pf output resource space 

V0.3.1 Hotfix for missing km_lib.dll

V0.4 Command bunker and performance fix

V0.5 Fix for reattachment of grabbers (hopefully)

* Grabbers should now be attachable multiple times
* Improved grabber collision meshes for better grabbing
* Turned Philly and large grabber around so that "control from here" works better

V2.0: New KM Folder structure

* Compatibility for 0.24 and new folder structure

Installation:
Important! Please follow the steps EVERY TIME you update a Klockheed Martian Mod! All public releases are located here:
~~https://www.dropbox.com/sh/r93q90vpb...4h1_WtfFGa/KSP~~

a) Download the latest version of the base Klockheed Martian Mod from here. It is just called "Klockheed_Martian".
b) Download the desired Klockheed Martian mods (e.g., Klockheed_Martian_SSE for Space Shuttle Engines).
c) Delete the Klockheed Martian base folder (GameData\Klockheed_Martian).
d) If you update mod, delete its folder too (e.g., GameData\Klockheed_Martian_SSE)
d) Unzip both files and copy the GameData folders to your GameData Folder.

The base folder is required for common plugin functionality that is shared by all Klockheed Martian mods.
